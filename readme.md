## What's new in v1.58.181
- Rebuilt in-Spotify settings with a cleaner section layout, Lucide icons, status badges and smoother panel motion.
- Introduced the new opt-in AI feature set: separate Meaning and Sound lanes for translation and pronunciation/transliteration.
- New AI setup supports Gemini, official OpenAI and custom OpenAI-compatible providers with provider-scoped credentials, model checks and visible request status.
- New layered results can show a Google preliminary result immediately, then let accepted AI translation or reading supersede it.
- New review and cache handling lets accepted AI results be reused without re-running paid work.
- Improved Arabic/Hebrew right-to-left and mixed-script lyric layout.

## Features
- Full-screen synced lyrics — Spicy karaoke wash, per-word animation, interludes.
- Live current line in the player, with a ♪ placeholder on no-lyric tracks.
- Transliteration: Japanese (furigana / romaji / both), Chinese (pinyin / jyutping), Korean / Cyrillic / Greek — optionally per-word.
- Google Translate.
- Optional AI translation and pronunciation/transliteration features.
- In-Spotify settings; works even when Spotify itself has no lyrics.

## Install
APK from [Releases](../../releases). 

Download language models in Settings to enable readings. Lyrics remain available without the pack.

**Rooted (LSPosed):** install, enable, scope to Spotify — you know the drill.

**Non-rooted (LSPatch):**
Spotify enforces Play Integrity during login. Bypass this using the **Downgrade-Login-Upgrade** method:

1. Download two Spotify APKs: an older version (e.g., `v8.9.18`) and the target version (`v9.1.28.2252`).
2. Patch both APKs with Spicy EX using [LSPatch](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPatch) (ensures matching signatures).
3. **Uninstall** current Spotify and **install the patched OLD version**.
4. **Log in** (Email/Password only, no Google/Facebook).
5. **Install the patched NEW version** over the old one as an update.

> [!NOTE]
> Tested on Spotify **v9.1.28.2252**.

> [!WARNING]
> May conflicts with ReVanced / modified Spotify or old Spotify Plus 

## Build
JDK 21 and an Android SDK are required. Gradle wrapper builds should be run with JDK 21; newer JDKs can fail during build-script compilation. The Android app still targets Java 11 bytecode unless that is changed intentionally.

```sh
# Build the debug APK and copy the stamped APK into artifacts/.
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk21 ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug

# Run the primary JVM unit suite.
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk21 ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

The single APK includes transliteration, translation, language dictionaries, extra fonts, and Spotify Connect support.

Language models (kuromoji, CharSoup, JMdict) are not in the APK; they are
delivered as a separate pack that the app downloads from Settings. Create the
versioned archive with `:app:packageLanguageModelPack` (JMdict sources live in
`app/language-models/`), publish it over HTTPS, and point builds at it with
`-PLANGUAGE_MODEL_PACK_URL=...` and its SHA-256 in
`-PLANGUAGE_MODEL_PACK_SHA256=...`.

Docs-only changes do not require unit/device testing. Device behavior remains the final validation path for UI, hook, and Spotify-host integration changes.
