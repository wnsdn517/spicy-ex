# Spicy EX Feature Guide

Spicy EX is an Xposed/LSPosed module that adds a Spicy Lyrics-style experience to Spotify. It
replaces the basic lyric surface with a richer fullscreen lyric screen, a live now-playing lyric
card, language-learning helpers, translation, and visual customization.

This is the user-facing feature list.

## APK Contents

- The APK includes transliteration, romanization, translation, language dictionaries,
  extra fonts, the complete lyric renderer, and the HyperGlow bridge.

## Lyrics Experience

- Fullscreen synced lyrics inside Spotify.
- Spicy-style karaoke wash that follows the current lyric timing.
- Line-, word- and syllable-timed lyrics when the source provides them.
- Top-to-bottom, block-horizontal and sentence-horizontal lyric fill.
- Spotlight, glow and interlude animation.
- Static/unsynced lyric fallback when line timing is unavailable.
- Interlude indicators between sung lines, using dots or a music note.
- Loading, empty, error, and no-lyrics states.
- Optional "stay in lyrics" behavior so the lyric screen remains open across track changes.
- Tap-to-seek on lyric rows, configurable as off, single tap, or double tap.
- Manual sync offset from -5000 ms to +5000 ms.
- Jump back to the current lyric after manual scrolling.
- Dedicated lyrics entry when Spotify does not expose its native lyric card.

## Now-Playing Lyrics

## HyperGlow Integration

- Publishes original lyrics, timing, metadata, generated transliteration, and
  translation together with the playback lifecycle.
- No Spotify bearer token is sent to HyperGlow.

## In-Spotify Settings

- Settings panel inside Spotify.
- English and Simplified Chinese settings/report UI. The `Interface language` row stays English so
  it remains findable after a language change.
- Controls grouped by lyrics, transliteration, translation, now-playing, text, animation, and
  background.
- Cache actions:
  - clear translation cache
  - clear lyrics response cache
- Status panel with last lyric state and build version.
- User-triggered private problem reports with a 30-minute privacy-safe event capture, readable JSON
  preview, public data-policy link, and a report ID for a separately opened formatted GitHub issue.
- Reports may include the current track identity and bounded current lyric lines shown in preview.
  They never include Spotify tokens, full logcat, LSPosed logs, or screenshots. Upload is manual and
  is never performed in the background.
- `app/translation/strings-template.xml` provides the complete XML key set for new translations.

## Installation And Distribution

- Rooted install through LSPosed.
- Non-root LSPatch flow documented for patched Spotify APKs.
- APK releases published to the public Spicy EX repository.
- Listed through the LSPosed Modules Repo.

## Current Limits

- Spotify login behavior under non-root LSPatch still depends on the documented downgrade-login-upgrade
  flow.
- Japanese song-specific custom readings can still be wrong when the written lyric uses an artistic
  reading that dictionaries cannot know.
- Mandarin pinyin still has known polyphone/context limits.
- Russian/Ukrainian Cyrillic is romanization, not full pronunciation.
- Greek support is a static romanization table, not a full Greek phonology engine.
